CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory C:/Users/Marta/Documents/GitHub/CAProject2/cmake-build-release/_deps/googletest-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Users/sandr/OneDrive/Documentos/GitHub/CAProject2/cmake-build-release/_deps/googletest-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
